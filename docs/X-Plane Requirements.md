LATA builds all movements on taxiways and service roads it finds in X-Plane airport definition files.

On startup, LATA will load the definition of the airport:

- Runways,
- Taxiways (ideally organized in a network),
- Ramps (aircraft parking positions),
- Service roads (ideally organized in a network),
- Parking and destination positions.

If some data is missing or mis-constructed, LATA will fail building routes.

Please refer to X-Plane World Editor and airport file format (apt.dat files) for constructing such data. It is beyond the scope of this plugin.
