The Little Airport Turnaround Activity (LATA) plugin or side application generates object movement files that can be processed by the [Living Scenery Technology](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/82876-living-scenery-technology/) (LST) plugin. It is a Living Scenery Technology *generator*.

All files that LATA generates are placed in a custom scenery folder called LATA and do not interfere with other sceneries. LST will find and load those files when started and generate appropriate objects and their movements. LATA manages all generated files, including their removal when no longer needed.

LATA generates movement files based on user requests.

There are two methods to generate that activity. In X-Plane, [[User Interface|the LATA plugin interface]] allows for creation of one or more random turnarounds and vehicle moments, to quickly generate activity on the ground of the airport and around you. It is the simplest way to generate random activity.

LATA also has a [[Command Line Interface and API|client application]] that allows for creation of precise, scheduled and coordinated movements. In this case, it is necessary to supply information such as [[Movements|movement type]], ramp positions to use, and timing.
