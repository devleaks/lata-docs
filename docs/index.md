Little Airport Turnaround Activity (LATA) is a X-Plane plugin that generates animation on the ground of an airport.

The original goal is to generate turnaround activity around an aircraft, with the coordinated movement of ground support vehicles around the aircraft in timely fashion.

However, the flexibility of the plugin allow for a lot more generation of activity around the airport. It can generate activity around your aircraft, or any other aircraft at the airport. It can even animate aircrafts like any other model.

The plugin generates activity based on instructions it receives. It does not coordinates activities or even ground movements. It does not control ground traffic. Generated traffic may happily collide if instructed to do so.

This plug in only generate activity on the *ground of an airport*, on the taxiways and service roads of that airport. It does not generate activity in the surroundings, roads, highways or even water.

[[How It Works|Here]] is a little explanation of how it works.
